    <p>1. What are the advantages of using the Raspberry Pi Pico W for an obstacle-avoiding robot compared to the standard Raspberry Pi Pico?
        Answer:
        The Raspberry Pi Pico W offers several advantages for an obstacle-avoiding robot:
        •	Wireless Connectivity: The Pico W includes Wi-Fi, which allows for remote control or monitoring of the robot, as well as potential updates or data logging without needing a physical connection.
        •	Network Integration: It can be integrated into a network, enabling features like real-time data streaming or integration with other networked devices.
        •	Enhanced Flexibility: The Pico W can leverage online resources or cloud services for advanced functionalities, such as remote diagnostics or updates.
        2. How would you utilize the Wi-Fi capabilities of the Raspberry Pi Pico W in your obstacle-avoiding robot project?
        Answer:
        Wi-Fi capabilities can be utilized in several ways:
        •	Remote Monitoring: Send sensor data to a remote server or cloud service for monitoring and analysis.
        •	Remote Control: Allow users to control the robot or adjust parameters via a web interface or mobile app.
        •	Data Logging: Continuously log data from the robot’s sensors to a cloud database for further analysis or troubleshooting.
        •	Firmware Updates: Implement over-the-air (OTA) updates to improve or modify the robot’s software without needing physical access.
        3. Can you describe the process of integrating an ultrasonic sensor with the Raspberry Pi Pico W for obstacle detection?
        Answer:
        The integration process involves the following steps:
        1.	Wiring: Connect the ultrasonic sensor’s VCC and GND pins to the Pico W’s 3.3V and ground pins. Connect the Trigger and Echo pins to GPIO pins on the Pico W.
        2.	Code Setup: Use the machine library to configure the GPIO pins. Implement a function to send a pulse from the Trigger pin and measure the pulse duration on the Echo pin.
        3.	Distance Calculation: Calculate the distance to an obstacle using the time it takes for the echo to return, applying the formula: distance = (duration * speed of sound) / 2.
        4.	Obstacle Avoidance: Use the distance measurements to decide movement commands and steer the robot to avoid obstacles.
